### Backlog:
- `SitePrism::Page#wait_until_displayed` - Re-call existing method and re-raise
- Create iFrame specs (Even though private methods)
- Create Test Helper and isolate all classes into single definition/s (CSS/XPath pages)
- Split up `page_spec.rb` into composite test files
- Split up `section_spec.rb` into composite test files
